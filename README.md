Treat String Like A Pebble With Grapheme At Kotlin 🫧   
The Easy Way To Use Emoji 🚀
</br>
</br>

## Why Pebble?
In Android, String is encoded in UTF-8, which means characters like emojis may not count as a single character.   
```kotlin
"🚀".length() == 2
```

To address this inconvenience, Pebble Is Coming!
</br>
</br>

## Gradle Settings
Add the codes below to your **root** `build.gradle` file (not your module-level build.gradle file):
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```   

And, Add the dependency below to your **module** `build.gradle` file:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.chattymin:pebble:0.1.0")
}
```
</br>
</br>

## How To Use?
```kotlin
"🚀".graphemeLength == 1
"🚀".isEmoji() == true
"Hello Pebble 🚀 Welcome!".containsEmoji() == true
"Hello🚀 This is Pebble!🫧 Welc🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒ome :)".extractEmojis() == ["🚀", "🫧", "🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒"]
"Hello🚀 This is Pebble!🫧 Welc🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒ome :)".filterEmojis() == "Hello This is Pebble! Welcome :)"
```
In addition to this, various types of extension functions are also available.   
The goal is to cover all ranges officially provided by Kotlin.

You can explore and use various extension functions within the `Pebble` module :)
